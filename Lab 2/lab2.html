            <p> pingdom.com helped me out with this and it showed that images take up 80% of
                the data which makes it slow down. There are high res images that load which affects the sites
            loading speed so i would take away some images on the site. In addition there are lots of redirections
            on the site like words and images, which slows the site down. I would take away some of those redirections and clean it up a bit
            to have less so the site loads quicker.

        <h4> #3 </h4>
            <p> 
                WAVE helped me with this and I found that 10 linked images were missing alternative text.
                This affects accessability because if you were blind you would want to be able to hear what the image is. This is an
                easy fix and I would add alt text in the code respectively.
                In addition I found 6 alerts of a redundant link. This is confusing to people because it gets in the way of navigating
                to new material. So I would have less redundant links and more links that take you to new content, so it doesnt confuse the user.
